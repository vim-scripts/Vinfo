Vinfo is a Vim plugin that allows you to read Info documentation files right inside a Vim session in a Vim-help fashioned way or from a shell just the way you normally use Info.


Usage
=====

Vinfo can be used right inside a Vim session or from a shell using an alias.

Use inside Vim
--------------------

You can use Vinfo inside Vim with:

:Vinfo doc

Where doc is the Info documentation to read.

Example: Read Glibc Info documentation

:Vinfo libc

Use outside Vim
----------------------

When your are not inside a Vim session but in the shell prompt you can invoke Vinfo as a command by using the following shell script:

    #! /bin/sh
    vim -c \"Vinfo $1\" -c &#039only&#039

Save it in /usr/bin/ as a file named vinfo, give it execution permission with:

$ chmod +x /usr/bin/vinfo

Then from your shell you can read a DOC with:

$ vinfo doc
